# Refunds

Cashier offers full support for refunds. Refunds can only be performed against _paid_ Orders. 

## Performing a complete refund

If you need to refund an order completely, invoke the `refundCompletely` method on its instance:

```php
use App\Models\User;

$user = App\User::find(1);

$order = $user->orders->first();
$order->refundCompletely();
```

## Refunding orders that used credit

An order can be paid partly (or entirely) from the owner's credit balance. In that case only
`total_due` is actually charged through Mollie, and that is the most Mollie is able to refund.

Cashier settles refunds against the Mollie payment first and against the credit used last. A
refund is capped at whatever is still refundable through Mollie, and anything it reverses beyond
that is returned to the owner's credit balance:

```php
// Order total EUR 22.00, of which EUR 5.00 was paid using credit and EUR 17.00 through Mollie.
$order->refundCompletely();
// -> EUR 17.00 is charged back through Mollie
// -> EUR 5.00 is returned to the owner's credit balance
```

The refund still reverses the full order value, so the credit order and invoice cover the
complete order.

The credit is returned when a refund is processed. When a refund includes a Mollie amount, this
happens after Mollie reports it as processed. A credit-only follow-up refund, after the Mollie
amount has already been exhausted by an earlier refund, is processed immediately without another
Mollie API call. A refund that ends up `failed` moves no credit at all, so a failed refund can never
leave credit behind for a refund that did not happen. Successive partial refunds return credit once,
as each processed refund reverses more than was charged through Mollie.

An order that was paid entirely using credit, or that has already been refunded in full, has
nothing left to charge back through Mollie and will throw a `LogicException`.

## Performing advanced refunds

For a finer grained control, build a refund manually:

```php
use Laravel\Cashier\Refunds\RefundItem;

$shippingCosts = RefundItem::make([
    'owner' => $user,
    'description' => 'Shipping costs',
    'currency' => 'EUR',
    'quantity' => 1,
    'unit_price' => 667, // EUR 6.67
    'tax_percentage' => 21,
]);

$order->newRefund()
    ->addItem(RefundItem::makeFromOrderItem($order->items->first()))
    ->addItem($shippingCosts)
    ->create();
```

## Credit orders and invoices

When Mollie has paid out the refund to the customer, Cashier dispatches the `RefundProcessed` event.

From this event you can get the automatically generated credit order and the matching invoice receipt:

```php
$creditOrder = $refundProcessedEvent->refund->order;
$invoice = $creditOrder->invoice();
$invoice->view(); // get a Blade view
$invoice->pdf(); // get a pdf of the Blade view
$invoice->download(); // get a download response for the pdf
```

Note that the credit Order and the invoice are a regular Cashier order and invoice. This means these are included when listing the billable orders and invoices:

```php
$user->orders;
$user->orders->invoices(); // includes credit invoices
```
